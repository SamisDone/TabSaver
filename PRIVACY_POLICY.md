🛡️ Privacy Policy for TabSaver

Effective Date: [26/10/2025]

Thank you for using TabSaver (“we”, “our”, or “us”).
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information our Chrome extension collects, how we use it, and your rights.

1. Information We Collect

TabSaver does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information from users.
The extension operates entirely within your browser and may use local storage to save your preferences or tab data — this information never leaves your device.

Specifically:

We do not collect or transmit personal data.
We do not use analytics or tracking tools.
We do not use cookies or third-party services.

2. Local Storage

TabSaver may store small pieces of data (like saved tabs or settings) using Chrome’s storage.local API.
All data remains on your local device and can be deleted anytime by uninstalling the extension or clearing browser data.

3. Permissions

TabSaver requests minimal permissions necessary for functionality.
These may include:

tabs — to read and save open tab information.
storage — to save user settings locally.

These permissions are used only for providing the features of the extension.

4. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties.
Your usage data remains completely private.

5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Any updates will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
